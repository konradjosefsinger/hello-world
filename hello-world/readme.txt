# Git
## Why the fuck is Git so damn confusing?
Honestly, the concept should be quite simple: You have a project folder many people can work on - just as with every other project, let it be a 3D design, or a film-cut, or a music-project: all the time we have a master-file/folder, where the people who work on the project can contribute to. But fuck it, for coding-projects Git makes it so damn difficult...
But - The first steps are always the hardest :)
